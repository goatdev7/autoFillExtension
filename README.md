# Chrome Job Form Filler Extension

## Overview

This Chrome extension simplifies the process of filling out repetitive fields on job application forms. It stores user-provided data and automatically populates common form sections, saving time during application submissions. There are multiple such extensions free to use but this was a custom extension I made to automate the repetitive tasks and learn along the way.
